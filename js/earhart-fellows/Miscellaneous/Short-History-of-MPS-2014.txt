INTRODUCTION 


In 1995 the Liberty Fund published A 
History 
of 
the 
Mont 
Pelerin 
Society, written by the Oxford historian (and past President of the Society), Professor Max Hartwell. The book is comprehensive, butis now difficultto obtain; and muchhas happened since 1995. So the Board ofthe Society asked me to précis the History 
and bring it up to date, giving members and prospective members a short guide to the history and ethos of the Society and to some of the key individuals and events that have shaped it. The Society and I arevery grateful tothefamilyof our friend Max Hartwell for their permission to borrow very heavily from his 
work. 


WHAT 
IS 
THE 
MONT 
PELERIN 
SOCIETY? 


Hartwell opens hisHistory 
by saying that the Mont Pelerin Society is “not well known” and has “no demonstrably proven role in world affairs.” 


Many of its individual members,by contrast have indeed been well known and influential. Somehave become senior government ministers (such as Sir Geoffrey Howe of theUnited Kingdom, Antonio Martino of Italy, RuthRichardson of New Zealand, and George Shultz of the United States) or senior officials (e.g. former Federal ReserveChairman Arthur Burns). A few have even becomepresidents or prime ministers (among them Ludwig Erhard of Germany, Luigi Einaudi of Italy, 
Mart Laarof Estonia, RanilWickremasinghe of Sri Lanka and Václav Klaus of theCzechRepublic). And others, including academics, educators, journalists, authors, businesspeople and many in policy research institutes, have wielded 
influencein other ways. 


But theyhave done all this as individuals, not as representatives of the Mont Pelerin Society. The Society’s contribution to world affairs is its provision of a forum for debate, discussion, study and self-education among its members, not through political action. It has no official views, formulatesno policies, publishes 
no manifestos, aligns itself with no party, and accepts no political or public 
funding. It does not even try to reach agreement in its discussions; no votes are taken, and to promote frank argument, its proceedings go unreported. 


The 
battle 
of 
ideas 


The Society arose as a response to the social, political, intellectual and moral ruin that had gripped Europe before and during World War II. It aimedto keep alight the intellectual flame ofliberalism (the wordis used in the European sense) in the dark postwar days and to critique the centralizing interventionist notions that then prevailed. The original members, writes Hartwell, “shared 
acommon sense ofcrisis– aconvictionthat freedomwasbeing threatened and that 



something should be done about it.” That threat, they concluded, was theresult 
of erroneous theories about history, society and economics. So they committed themselves,not to political action, but towinning the intellectual battle ofideas. 


The Societyhas played a crucial role in that battle. It has done more thanjust keep liberal ideas alive; it has expanded and deepenedliberal philosophy and spread liberal thought across the globe. Equally profound and even more subtlehas been the strength, courage, friendship, learning and ideas that members draw 
from each other. Andas members of the Society, liberals who may otherwisefeel 
intellectually isolated and overwhelmed can take strengthfrom the realization 
that they arenot alone in their views. 


The Mont Pelerin Society achieves all this, even thoughit exists “mainly in the 
minds and affections of its members,” as Hartwell puts it. TheSociety has no 
offices or endowment. Its work isdone bya Board ofelected, unsalariedmembers 
from many countries, withonly part-time paid administrative support. The large 
international conferences that it holds all over the world areorganized and 
financed by local volunteer members. 


Strength 
through 
diversity 


The Society, then, exists for the mutual education, support and benefit of its members. It is a loose association of peoplewhobelieve in the power ofideas to 
change the world, and who support the ideaof afreesociety–evenif they 
disagree profoundly on exactly what that means or exactly how it can beachieved. TheSociety’sfounder, the Austrian-born British economist, politicalphilosopher(and later, Nobel laureate) Friedrich Hayek, saw it as “akind of internationalacademy” for discussing and diffusing liberal ideas.Not ‘academy’ inthe sense of being confined to college teachers and students, but an academy in the sense of a meeting placefor anyone seeking debate and self-education. 


Over the years there have been arguments – almost to thepoint of destruction, as 
we shall see – about how ‘activist’ the Society should be; but it has alwaysresisted 
calls to be more political and remained true toits founding aim, of bringingtogetherpeople who wish to defend, support and develop a liberal philosophy. 


That, of course, covers a wide range of views. Members ofthe Societyhaveverydifferent conceptions of society (e.g. anarchists, libertarians and classicalliberals)and very different approaches (e.g. methodological individualists and neoclassical 
marginalists)on a variety of issues (e.g. a gold standard, managed or floating exchange ratesand the size and role of government). While, there is “general agreement about the kindof liberal economicandpolitical order that would promote stability and freedom,”says Hartwell, it remains “difficult to spell out the details of such an order thatwould have the approval of all members.”Indeed it is:but that is a mark of the Society’s intellectual fecundity, not its failure. 


PREHISTORY 
OF 
THE 
MONT 
PELERIN 
SOCIETY 



The twentieth century was characterizedby the politicization of life: bigger 
government, public decisions replacing private responsibilities and the erosion oflong-held freedoms. The century also brought us wild economic fluctuations,stagflation and two world wars. Many liberalsbelieve this is not just coincidence. 


The debate about the proper sizeof government and its effects on society goes 
back centuries, of course; but the seeds of the great twentieth-century expansionof government were sown in the nineteenth. Capitalism was criticized asfailingthe poor. At the same time, breakthroughs in science and engineering made 
reformers imagine that social and economic life could be engineered too, and that the evil of povertycould be eliminated through rational policy. Welfare states were created, and governments took on much broader functions, all of whichexpanded and grew. By 1926, the influential Cambridge economistJohn Maynard 
Keynes could write the epitaph ofthe free economy, The 
End 
of 
Laissez-Faire. 


Hayek’s 
proposal 


It was inCambridge,where Keynes found him roomsat King’s College during the 
evacuation of the London School of Economics during World War II, that Hayek 
wrote The 
Road 
to 
Serfdom. Published in 1945, it explained how even well intentioned efforts to redesignsociety couldultimately threaten human freedom itself. Germany in the 1930s provideda dismal example of life without freedom; butfew in Europe saw the connection between economic and social planning and the gradual erosion of freedom. Thestrongly prevailing view was that ‘rational’ government intervention was both desirable and inevitable. 


Given the horrors of the previous decade, Hayek knew that countering this 
prevailing view was urgently important. At aJanuary 1944 meeting in King’s 
College, chaired by the economic historian Sir John Clapham, he discussed 
whether Europe’s liberal civilization could ever be restored after the War. The 
next few years would be critical, he argued. Germany and others would need to rediscover the intellectual and moral values on which Europeancivilization had originally been built – values suchas the sacredness of truth, theimportance of individual freedom, democracy and “oppositionto all forms of totalitarianism, 
whether it befrom theRight or from theLeft.” To aid that re-birth, Hayek 
suggestedcreatinganinternational society “half-way between a scholarly 
institutionand a political society,”and a journal dedicatedto debating these 
principles. 


It was not thefirst such initiative. In 1938 the French philosopherLouis Rougierbrought together in Paris a number of liberals in Paris, hoping to form a society that might revive liberalism.They included Hayek and eleven others who would subsequently createthe Mont Pelerin Society. A second meeting of Rougier’sgroup was heldin January 1939, but the onsetof war made further meetings 
impossible. 


The 
huge 
challenge 



An internationalinitiative on the scale Hayekhadinmindwould be costly. But 
others were thinking onparallellines. In1945 theGerman-born political 
economist Wilhelm Röpke, (later a leading architect of Germany’s postwar socialmarket economy), also fearing the“mortal threat” of collectivism to Europe’s 
cultural inheritance, circulateda“plan for an international periodical” to tackle it. He asked Hayek and other intellectuals to contribute, and with the help of Swiss businessman Albert Hunold, began raising money for the venture. 


Inthe event,Röpkeraised much less than he needed; but his efforts had revealed 
the existence of a critical mass of liberal scholars in Europe and the United States. Hunold suggested that the money raised could be used to finance Hayek’s idea for a meeting. 


Hayek believed that a strong American showing was vital – though the travel costs were daunting. Fortunately doors were opened by the hugepopularityof 
The 
Road 
to 
Serfdom 
in America and thesuccess of Hayek’s lecture tour thereto promoteit. TheWilliam VolkerCharities Fund agreed tomeet thecosts ofthe American participants, while Hunold secured finance for theEuropeans. At last the meetingproposed by Hayek almost threeyears earlier could go ahead. 


THE 
FOUNDING 
OF 
THE 
SOCIETY 


“Hayek’s arguments for the formation of the Mont Pelerin Society were both intellectual and practical,” writes Hartwell. Intellectually, he believed that a new 
version of liberalism had to be written, one that could be appliedto the social problems of the day,instead of just leaving the argument to the interventionists. And in practical terms, Hayek knew that the talents of isolatedliberals had to be 
brought together and orchestratedmore effectively. 


In December 1946– slightly anticipating success on thefunding front – Hayek sent invitations to fifty-eight people to attendthe meeting. It would take place on 1-10 April 1947,atthe Hôtel du Parc in the Swiss mountain village of MontPèlerin 
(meaning Mt Pilgrim), overlooking Lake Geneva.It was short noticeand some (suchas Antony Fisher, the British businessman who subsequently founded the Instituteof Economic Affairs) could not come. But Hayek saw noreasonto delay in a task he thought sourgent. 


Thirty-nineparticipants made it to Mont-Pèlerin. They came from ten countries, 
seventeen of them having made thelong journey from America. Most were 
academics, twenty of them economists. Another eight came from other fields 
including law, history,political science, chemistry and philosophy. But the group 
also included businesspeople, journalists and think-tankers. 


The 
weighty 
agenda 


It was indeed a critical time. Aftertwo world wars separated by a massiveeconomic depression, people now craved security morethan freedom.During 
World War II, governments hadtaken direct control of national economies: nowthere were calls to continue that central direction in order to ‘win the peace’. 



So therewould be plentyof issues for these talented liberals to grapple with 
during their ten daysin Mont-Pèlerin–as Hayek’slongagenda confirmed. What werethe essential characteristics of a competitive order? What should be done about monetary instability? Should governments regulatemonopolies, wages and agriculture? Can governmentskeepunemployment down? How should nonmarket 
goods be produced and distributed? Is security and solidarity more 
important than competitionand economic growth?Is liberalisma matter ofbelief, or can its correctness be demonstrated logically? Is a free economy 
necessary for a free society? How important to liberalism is religion? How far has the appreciation of liberal civilization been poisoned by the bias of politicizedhistorians? And the stark question of the times: Can Germany everbe 
rehabilitated? 


Unity 
and 
disagreement 


There is no detailed record of this inaugural meeting, though Hunold’s notes andmany of the papers delivered there still survive. But even though the participants 
shared a liberal outlook, it would have beenremarkable if they had been in completeharmony on these difficult questions. 


There were disagreements, for example, on the state control of monetary policy, on the roleof religion, on minimum wages andon the level of welfare provision 
that afree economy could bear. Some participants, such as Röpke and theSwiss academic and diplomat William Rappard, believed that liberalism hadto be 
tempered by the contemporary human desire for security. Others, such as the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, feared that such concessions were the first step down the road to serfdom, and took a robustly libertarianstance. Indeed, during the session on income distribution, where some participants wereexpressing support for theidea of progressive income taxes, Mises 
famously got up andcomplained:“You are all a bunch of socialists!” 


There was more agreement on how history had beenused as a weapon of illiberal propaganda, on the over-vaunted role and efficacy of government, and 
on the needfor constitutional values and therule of law as essential safeguards for liberty. And in general, there wasmoreto unitetheparticipants than divide 
them. They were, afterall, in their different ways, all liberals who all felt an urgent need to revitalize the liberal approach and the exposethe damaging errors of interventionism and socialism. 


Formulating 
a 
statement 


In his final circular before the conference, Hayek reminded them of their “common convictions” and on the necessity offormulating a statement of the 
“common principles onwhichthe work of the organization is to be based” – though this should not be any form of “public manifesto.” 


Yet there remained sufficient differences to makesuch a statement difficult to formulate. A committee of six produced a draft. Freedom, they insisted, was 



threatened down to its roots by the“intellectual error “of imagining there exist inevitable “laws of historical development” to which moral standards must be sacrificed. Freedom, they argued, could survive only alongside “an effective competitive market” which in turnrequired “a proper legal and institutional framework.” And if state power was not to erode the free society, “government activity should be limited bytherule of law.” 


Butthegroupcould notagreeon this draft. Perhaps it was too specific, too long and too uncompromising. Lionel Robbins, of the London School of Economics, was asked to rewrite it. His version, agreed and signed by everyone apart from the Frencheconomist and physicist Maurice Allais, remains the Society’s guiding statement even to this day. 


The 
statement 
of 
aims 


This Statement 
of 
Aims 
begins starkly: “The central values of civilization are in 
danger,”it warns.In some countries,freedomhas disappearedentirely; in others 
it is “underconstant menace.” Even freedom of thoughtand expression is being 
curbed. Freedom is being sacrificed to “a view of history which denies all 
absolute moral standards”and “questions the desirability ofthe rule of law.” 


This, it says, requires study on several fronts: explaining the crisis of the time;redefining the functions ofthe state; reaffirming the ruleof law;establishing 
minimumstandards that arecompatible with the market; combating the misuse 
of history; and safeguarding international peace, liberty, and trade. 


The Statement 
concludes by emphasizing the intellectual – and not political – 
purposeof the Society. “The groupdoes not aspire to conduct propaganda,” it insists, nor define some precise orthodoxy. It is politically unaligned,aimingonly to help preserve and improve the free society by“facilitating theexchange of views among minds inspired by certain ideals and broad conceptions held in common.” 


The 
choice 
of 
name 


Another organizational question for the group was whatto call itself. Originally, 
Hayek thought of taking a name from some great liberalthinker. He considered 
several before alighting on the English historian and statesman Lord Acton 
(1834-1902) – an independent minded democrat who knew that “power tends tocorrupt” and to whom morality andlibertywere supreme values,not something 
that could besacrificed to some politicalend. To this, Hayek added the name of 
Alexis de Tocqueville(1805-1859), the French statesman and political thinker 
whowroteof his “passionate love for liberty, law and respect for rights.” Hayek’s suggestion of ‘The Acton-Tocqueville Society’ would unite the names of thesetwo great liberals. 


But the participants at Mont-Pèlerin could not agree. Acton’s name did not command general approval; Mises pointed out that de Tocqueville had served 
under Napoleon; theyoung American economist Milton Friedman thoughtthe 



group should be namedafter principles, not individuals. As an alternative, theFrenchphilosopher and economist Bertrand de Jouvenelproposed ‘An Academy for theStudy of the Philosophy of a Free Society’, but Robbins disliked the word 
‘Academy’. 


Eventually the German-American economist Karl Brandt suggested simply naming the group after theplace where they were meeting. The Austrian-British 
philosopher Karl Popper thought that sucha name would bemeaningless. But since no othername could be agreed, Brandt’s suggestion was adopted and,inits 
anglicized form, the name ‘Mont PelerinSociety’ is still usedtoday. Its“meaningless” nature actually becamea boon: the name does not commit the Society to any particular views, and excludes no one. 


ORGANIZATION 
AND 
FINANCE 


Incorporation 
and 
tax 
exemption 


By November that year, the Society was formally registeredin the United Statesas a non-profit corporation, now with more than sixty members. Its stated purposewas “To study and promote the study of political, economic, historical, 
moral and philosophic aspects of civil society having a bearing upon the institutionaland organizational conditions compatible withfreedom of thought and action.” It would also “holdand sponsor meetings” and“issue reports, announcements and other documents.” 


In early 1952 the US authorities confirmed the Society’s tax-exemptstatus,recognizing it as “organized and operated exclusively for education purposes,” intended “to facilitate an exchange of ideas” on “theprinciples and practice of a 
free society” and to “study the workings, virtuesand defects” of market systems. 


Early 
governance 


The original Memorandum of Association set up a nine-member Board and a Councilcomprising the Board membersand six others. But as Hartwell reports, “In practice, the division between the Board andthe Council was pointless” becausemost decisions were made, with the tacit agreement of the others, by Hayek as President and Hunold as European Secretary. 


That arrangement would cause major problems lateron, however, as Hunold came to assume moreand more power, to the consternation ofHayek and many 
other members. A committee set upin1962 to revisethe constitution proposed a more businesslike arrangement:to replace the Council with asingle Board of 
fifteen, comprising a President, Treasurer, Secretary and twelve others, from among whom VicePresidents would also be chosen.Board members (exceptofficers) would have a defined tenureand would retire in rotation. These 
recommendations were adopted at the 1964 meeting inSemmering, Austria and remain largely unchanged today. 



Organizational 
issues 


There was also much discussion onhow to further theaims of the Society.In1962, the English economist JohnJewkescomplainedthat theSociety had “done 
little or nothing to draw young people into membership.” Nor had it extendedits membership intocrucial areas such as Japan, Central America and South 
America. The national groupings,hewent on, were largely inactive. The Society 
was always short of funds, and thelack of a salaried secretariat meant that a huge amountofadministrativework fell onto an unpaid Secretary. 


Some of Jewkes’s suggestions, such as building up atrust fundand devolving the administration down to national levels, gathered little enthusiasm. Others, such as increasing membership dues and institutingfees for the (previously 
subsidized)meetings, were adopted – albeit largely out of necessity. 


The membership issues wereaddressed more squarely. By the 1968 meeting in Aviemore, Scotland, the Society’smembershipstood at about 350. Of those, 140 came from theUnited States and another 109 from Germany, France andtheUnited Kingdom. But other regions of the worldwere nowbetter represented. Japan had an impressive 21members, and there were at least a few from India, Brazil, Argentina, Chile,Uruguay and Venezuela. 


On the otherhand, size was now becoming an issue. The reach of the Society andits ideas was certainly expanding, but the intimacy of the original meeting at Mont-Pèlerinwas being lost. There were many, often conflicting, proposalson 
the subject. A working party of members from various countries couldnotagree 
on capping membership numbers, But one thing everyone agreed on wasthat 
the ad 
hoc 
membership arrangements that were tolerable for a society of afew 
dozen members, with sketchy nominations submitted at the last moment on scraps of paper, “should now be put on a more businesslike footing.” 


Looking at theprofile of the membership, the working party proposedthatpreference should be given to younger candidates, and to those fromcountries where the Society was poorly represented. To maintain standards, however, it recommended that candidates should not be considered for membership until they had attended at least onemeeting as a guest. 


The working party also recommended that more philosophers,historians andpolitical scientists should be admitted. Hayek himself did not intend that the Society should devote itself as much toeconomicquestions as it did. At the original 1947 meeting, he had expressed regret that the historians and political scientists werefar outnumberedby the economists. The feelingthat the Society should broaden its membership is one that has frequently resurfacedin the 
subsequent decades. 


The 
Montreux 
decisions 


The size, membershipand organization questions were thrashed out ataSpecial Meeting ofthe Board in Montreux,Switzerland, in1971. On membership, it 



imposed a five-year limit of 25 new members ayear. A Recruitment Committee would be set up to screen nominations and to search out prospective members. Membership dues would be doubled (from $10 to $20). 


On meetings, the Board agreed there should be General Meetings every twoor three years, with Special or Regionalmeetings in between.In general,guestswould have to be people thought suitable as future members. Guests should payhigher registration fees than members, thoughmembers should pay theactual cost of the conferences, without subsidy. Grants would be made to help younger prospectivememberstoattend. 


For the most part, the Semmerling constitution, modified by the Montreux decisions, still guide the Society today. The size and profile of the membership are constantly debated,but no major constitutional changes have attracted muchenthusiasm. 


THE 
SOCIETY’S 
FINANCIAL 
MANAGEMENT 


Sources 
of 
support 


The Mont Pelerin Society has never had a large endowment, and onlyrarely has 
it had any paidadministrative help. It flourishes only because of the loyalty ofitsmembers, the enormous voluntary effort of its office bearers, and the willingness of local groups to arrange meetings. 


Those meetingsmaytaketwoor more years to plan, involve ahugetimecommitment from local organizers and have to be self-financing– seldom have meetings been subsidized from central funds. Yet thereis no shortage of willing volunteers: the honour of hosting theSociety is reckoned to be reward enough. 


One enduring expense for anyinternational society, however, is travel; and for this purpose the Society has solicited specific grants fromfoundations for the 
travel of officers, speakers and young scholars. The Volker Fund financed the American participationin the inaugural meeting in 1947, and over the years generous grants have come from the Reim Foundation, the EarhartFoundation,the Lilly Endowment, the Roe Foundation, the John M Olin Foundation, the Scaife Family Charitable Trust, the Pierre and Edith Goodrich Foundation, the Garvey 
Foundation and other foundations, companies and individuals from many 
countries. Nor should one overlook the in-kind andlogistical support that officebearers rely on from their own companies,think tanks and academic departments. 


Hunold 
and 
the 
Quarterly 


Even so, there have been many financial strains along the way. In 1958 Albert Hunold,whoasEuropeanSecretaryshouldered mostof the administrative work, began to complain about the financialburden of it all. Since 1946,he said, his Institute had spent about $30,000and he personally had spent $20,000. He 



asked to be paid $3,000ayear, financed from higher membership dues andnew 
charges onthose attending conferences.FritzMachlup, asTreasurer, was 
shocked: he thought charging for meetings would excludeall the academics andleave the Society with only business members. 


Hunold was alsodetermined that the Society should have a journal, and published the first issues of The 
Mont 
Pelerin 
Quarterly 
in 1959. But this was not a cheap venture either: its costs far exceeded the $877 income of the Society. But Hunold raisedenough money to keep theQuarterly 
going until 1962 – though by 
then (as we shall see) relations between Hunold and other Board members had 
irretrievably broken down. On seeing the January 1962 edition, the Board 
disowned it. Hunold’s subsequentresignation, says Hartwell, “ended boththe 
conflict within the Society and the financial embarrassment theQuarterly 
could 
have become.” 


THE 
EARLY 
YEARS 


Activism 
or 
academy? 


In the Society’s early years there were also disagreements about how ‘activist’it should be. The first meeting was agreat success in terms of stimulating ideas and 
forging new contacts, but some members wantedto do more than just that. 


The divisions surfaced at thefirst Board meeting of the newlyincorporated Society in 1948. Some, such as Brandt, Hunold and the Americanjournalist (and laterPulitzer Prize winner) Felix Morley, considered thethreat of collectivism sogreat that quick practical action was necessary. The French economist andgovernment adviserJacques Rueffwantedthisto includetheSociety publishinga 
Liberal 
Manifesto 
directed at influencingpublic opinion. Others, including the 
German economist Walter Eucken, the Italianphilosopher Carlo Antoni and Hayek himself, wanted theSociety to focus on research and study that would and win the battle of ideas, discredit socialism and outline thealternative. 


This latter view prevailed, though disagreements persisted. Brandt and Rueff continued to press for a more policy-orientedapproach. Morley wanted the Society to be more “aggressive.” The Danisheconomist Carl Iversen thought that even a ‘scientific’Society could still work with policy groups. Leonard Read of the Foundation for Economic Education felt that without a policy role the Society had little future. 


A 
second 
conference 


Yet there was agreement that a second conference shouldbe held, if only to clarify the group’s purpose. Hunoldand Brandt, both on the ‘activist’ wing, raised the funds, and the meeting took place in Seelisberg, Switzerland in 1949. It discussed labor and wage issues, the role of the state in education and the demandfor social security: the Society was beginning to fashionits critique of postwar interventionism. But alongsidethe intellectual agenda, members 



debated theaims and future activities of theSociety. Brandt wanted an activesecretariat, vigorous fundraising, policy groups and publications. However, themajority did not agree. 


The discussion resumed at the 1950 meeting in Bloomendaal, Netherlands. Hayek argued, successfully, that the Society shouldbe a “community ofliberalscholars,” not a policy group. “He believed,” writes Hartwell,“that the Society’s competitive advantagelay in ideas, not in action, and that inthe long run the 
influenceof the Society would be greater if its efforts were intellectual rather than political.” 


With that settled, there followedadecade ofmore meetings: Beauvallon, France 
in 1951,Seelisberg again in 1953, Venice, Italy in 1954, Berlin, West Germany in 
1955, StMoritz,Switzerlandin 1954, Princeton, New Jersey in1958 and Oxford, 
England in1959.The Society grew in bothmembership andgeographical spread; by 1961 there were 258 members including several from Japan,South America, 
South Africa and New Zealand. 


Capitalism 
and 
the 
Historians 


One exception was made tothe no-publishing rule. Members wereso impressed 
by papersdelivered on history and capitalism that Hayek was asked to turn them 
into a book. 


Capitalism 
and 
the 
Historians, published commercially in1963, proved a great success. It showed how historians had misrepresented the effects ofEnglish industrialization on the mass thepopulation. They were using the writing of 
history to make history – distorting thefacts in the attempt toprove that 
capitalism had driven down the living standards of the workingclass. In fact, workers were flocking into the industrialtowns, which gave them a more secure 
living, and better facilities and opportunities, than they ever had on the land. 


Unresolved 
and 
emerging 
issues 


Yet by the 1959 Oxford meeting, more divisions wereemerging. Hayek wanted tohand over as President, but theobvious successors, Jewkes and Röpke, did not wish totake it on, so Hayek was persuaded to continue. Disagreements about the 
size of the Society also resurfaced: Should it be small and elite or largeand 
democratic? Some members worried that the Society’s size was now inhibiting 
discussion. “Unlimited growth,” Hayek agreed, “may change the character of the Society entirely.” 


There was debate too about the role of the Quarterly: should it be a learned journal, a policy broadsheet, or a members’ newsletter? And what were Hunold’s responsibilities? Was he in reality the Society’sChief Executive? How far did his authority extend? Andhow far should it? These would bethemost bitter questions that the Society ever faced. 


THE 
HUNOLD 
AFFAIR 



Until 1959, the Society had been essentially a two-man operation. Hayek, as 
President, initiated and managed the intellectual content while Hunold,as Secretary, raised money and managed the administration. But increasingly, Hunold was beginning to take charge. 


In Switzerland, Hunold was a man of some status: an intellectual as well as asuccessful business executive. He felt entitled to high status in the Mont PelerinSociety too. He was notjust a founding member.It was hisfunding initiative that 
breathed life into the Society in the first place.His ability to raise money was 
crucial to the success of the meetings. He worked long andhard on running the Society. And he spent alot ofhis own moneykeeping it going. 


Princeton 
and 
Oxford 


Hayek, keen to strengthen the Society’s American links, planned a US meeting in 1953 but could not raise the necessary funds. Yet by 1958, Machlup had secured financeforameetinginPrinceton– which, he claimed,would be the largest and 
most elaborate meeting yet held. 


And so it was. Behind the scenes, however, Hunold subjected the American 
organizers to constant interference and criticism. The principal donor, Jasper Craneof the DuPont Company, complained of Hunold’s “rudeness” andhowhe 
“quarrelled with everyone in Princeton.” Hunold also circulated a personal 
memoir,The 
Story 
of 
the 
Mont 
Pelerin 
Society, which disparaged the prominent Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter (who had earlier dismissed the Society as irrelevant). Machlupregarded the attack as unworthyof theSociety; and Hayek reported himself “thoroughly fed up” with Hunold’s conduct – even though he thought that Hunold was “indispensible forthe Society.” 


Hunold certainly felt himselfindispensible. He had raised money and organized 
previous meetings. He arranged everything for the successful 1956 Berlin meeting, including the program. His experience andsuccess in running meetings 
convinced him that heshould be the final authority in suchthings. 


But theOxford meeting in 1959 waseven more acrimonious than Princeton.Hunold objected to Fisherthat the conference was too English,with too many British speakers and notranslation services; it focused toomuch on economics;he wanted other speakers invited. He also objected that Ralph Harris, whom Fisher had hired torun the Institute of Economic Affairs, was centrally involved in planning the meeting, even though he was not yet a member. 


A 
civil 
war 


Hunold came to believe there was an Anglo-American conspiracy to replace him with the popular and energetic Harris. He opposed Harris’s membership, andwrote to Board members disparaging the role of Harris and the Institute of Economic Affairs in the Oxford conference, and demanding a re-vote on Harris’s 
membership. A flurry ofheated exchanges followed. 



Hunold’s third issue of the Quarterly 
in January 1960 inflamed things further. Hayek protested that, against Council policy, it expressed editorial opinions– 
andeven attacked individual members of the Society. Hunold, however, insisted on his editorial independence and control. For Hayek, it was the last straw. He saw furthercollaboration withHunold as impossible, and told Röpke(whoremained Hunold’s staunchsupporter) of his intention to resign as President. With it clear that either Hunold orHayek would have togo, factions began to coalesce and votes were canvassed. A circular to the whole membership from Hunold, replied to by another from Hayek, made the dispute public to all members, and made them aware of how deepit was. 


Kassel 
and 
Turin 


The Society’s eleventhmeeting, organized by Röpke and Hunold,took place in Kassel, West Germany in 1960. It was opened by Ludwig Erhard, the Economics Minister who had abolished thepostwar wageand pricecontrols and unleashed West Germany’s ‘economicmiracle’. Hunold saw the meeting as an opportunity to proclaim the success of liberal policies and ensured that Europeanand 
American newspapers were therein force – to the discomfort of members who believed the Society should not be so political. 


Intellectually, the meeting was a success, but the internal conflict raged. Erhard had to step in as peacemaker. It was not easy; Hunold felt he had every right tocontinue, but Hayekwould acceptno solution that left Hunold in power. 
Eventually a compromise was reached inwhichboth Hayekand Hunold stepped down from their offices, Röpke became interim President, the Italian political scientist and lawyer Bruno Leoni became European Secretary, and Hunold became Vice President and continued to produce the Quarterly. As Hartwell observes: “it is doubtful that Hunoldwould have accepted the solution hedidwithout the influence of Erhard’s prestige and authority, to which even Hunold 
deferred.” 


But theconflict soon resumed with Hunold’s minutes of the Kassel agreement, 
whichdiffered crucially from what othersthought had been decided. The discord re-surfacedagain at the 1961 meeting in Turin, Italy. The Treasurer, American social scientist Clarence E Philbrook, was affronted by Hunold’s suggestion that 
payments for the travel expenses of American participants at Kassel had been 
made illegally. Friedman, meanwhile, objected to the undignified remarks about 
John Kenneth Galbraith, thecritic of American capitalism, thatappeared in the 
Quarterly. Therewere arguments about the site of the next meeting, andhow far Hunold should beinvolved. There was even friction over the order inwhichthe 
Vice Presidents should belisted– and therefore, by implication, howhigh 
Hunold ranked. 


Hayek, Leoni and the Americans on the Councilconcluded thatthey could not 
“any further remain in the same Society with Dr Hunold.” For his part, Hunoldstill had many supporters – includingimportant ones such as the President, Röpke, and the American businessman and philanthropist Pierre Goodrich, who 



continuedtofund the Quarterly. But the situation was untenable. There were 
moves to exclude Hunold from theSociety entirely, led by the British business economist Arthur Shenfield and by Machlup, who was even prepared to see Röpke excluded for supposedly being untrue to the Kassel agreement. Underpressure to stand down, Röpkeresigned – notjust from office but from the 
Society too – and Hunold followed him out soon after. 


THE 
MEETINGS 
OF 
THE 
1960s 


The affair cast a pall over meetings that were otherwise considerable intellectual successes. The Turin meeting, for example, grappled with thepublic criticismoflarge-scale enterprises, especially multinationals, which had come to beseen as the main cause of the continuing dependency and poverty of theless developed economies. The participants felt that economic change and the rise in services 
would bring more opportunities for small firms. Mises, characteristically, rejected all state subsidies to businesses of any size, calling supportfor small businessesand farms a“romantic middle-class policy.” But the Germanneoliberals were keener to preserve a balance between largeand small firms. 


Another issue discussed in Turin was the worrying efforts of the Soviet Union toingratiate itself with the governments and citizens of less developed countries. 
How should liberal countries respond? Not by pumping in aid of their own, argued Brandt: rather, the West should aim to give these countries a vision of freedom and the benefits of markets over wasteful state spending, and to open up tothem through trade. 


As often before, the debate onthe international monetary system produced most disagreement. Some wanted a return to the gold standard; Friedmanand 
Machlupfavoured flexible exchange rates. The only consensus was the need for stability. It has been acontinuing debate among members of the Society. 


A 
second 
conflict 


On thepersonal level, a new conflictwas brewing, betweenJewkesand Leoni, the new President and Secretary. A disagreement about the siteof the next conference developed into yet another dispute about the relative power ofofficebearers. 
After the 1962 Knokke meeting in Belgium, Jewkes thought it important to have another meeting in 1963.“Leoni wanted to have a conference 
imaginatively sited on a boat sailing on the Rhine…or in France,” reports Hartwell, “but could not be certainof obtaining thenecessary funds.” So Jewkes proposed another meeting in Oxford. 


The Board and Council supported Oxford, but Leoni objected, sayingthat thefacilities (and food)in France were far superior. And perhapshe thought that returning to England might reinforce the perceived Anglo-American domination of the Society. Jewkes eventually defused the tension with a long conciliatory letter to Leoni, but it came too late tosave the 1963 conference: fearingthat 
pressing on with Oxford would simply perpetuate the disagreement, Jewkes had 



cancelled it, bitterly blaming the loss on Leoni’s “persistent and determinedopposition.” However, the Austrian aristocrat and philanthropist Max Thurn 
filled thegap by offering to organize a 1964meeting in Semmering, Austria. 


Moving 
on 
and 
outward 


The Semmering conference, attended by 240 people, wasa great success. Past disputes were put aside and a new and more businesslike constitutionwas adopted, allowing the Society to concentrate on its intellectual task. 


But as the meetings grew, so didtheproblems of financing them. Funds were 
usually raised from local sources, as the Society had littleofits own to fund conferences or meet deficits. A proposed 1965 meetingin Venezuela hadto beabandoned becauseof lack of finance, though Leoni was able to organize ameeting in Stresa, Italy for that year. At Stresa, plans wereagreed for an ambitious newventure: a Special Meeting in Tokyo, Japan, as proposedbyHayek’s student Chiaki Nishiyama. Thenew Board elected in Stresa looked more cosmopolitan too, including both a Central American and a Japanese. 


Funding thetravel ofAmerican and European participants in Tokyo would be a big challenge for the organisers of the Japan meeting. But a grant from the Reim Foundationhelped, and the meeting was a great success. Japan now became an important national center forthe Society. Therewould beother meetings in 
Japan in 1988 and2008. 


Setbacks 
and 
success 


Plans wereagreed for a meeting in Vichy, France and another in Aviemore, Scotland. Meetings were now coming thick andfast. 


But there were setbacks. In late1967, the newPresident, Bruno Leoni,was murdered by an employeewith whom he was indispute. Ralph Harris, now 
planning the 1968 Aviemore meeting, informed theBoardand suggested that theSenior VicePresident, Frencheconomist Daniel Villey, should take over. But Villey had a heart condition and was reluctant. So too was Friedman, who had too many other commitments.Eventually theGerman economist FriedrichLutz,a past President, was persuaded to return on an interim basis. 


These setbacks did not prevent a successful meeting inAviemore going ahead; and the Society branched outagain with a1969 meeting inCaracas, Venezuela. It could look forward withconfidence tocelebratingitstwenty-fifthanniversary. 


THE 
1970s 


Friedman’s 
concerns 


Or could it? Some members were still uneasy about the Society’s growth – including Friedman, who in 1970 became its first non-EuropeanPresident. 



Friedman thoughtthe anniversary a good opportunity totake stock, and circulated hisviewsand concerns to members. He pointed out that the number of peoplenow attending meetings meant that venues were overloaded, so that participants found themselves spread between different hotels, which inhibited “free-wheeling discussion.” Large meetings also required years ofplanning; could the Society count on volunteers coming forward eachtime? And the big format had deadened the debate: meetings had become “tourist attractions” 
rather than exciting intellectual exercises. 


To discuss these issues, Friedman arranged a Special Board MeetinginMontreux in 1971,with about a dozen other senior members in attendance. Friedman himself wassceptical about the Society’s future. On theplus side, he argued, it 
had served four important functions: it put liberals in communication witheach 
other; it stimulated the exchange of ideas; it promoted learning;and itcreated greater understanding of the foundations of afree society. But he also felt that if it could not re-create the spirit, intimacy and intellectual thrill of the early meetings, theSociety might be better to go out “in a blazeof glory.” 


The Board was not minded todisband the Society; the threat to freedom was still profound.Instead it resolved to limit recruitment,screen applicants more thoroughly, control the size and format of meetings, and raise an endowment tomaintain a permanent secretariat. (In the event, however, not all these resolutions were carried out; the Society and its meetings continued to grow insizeand the pursuit of an endowment was half-hearted.) 


The 
anniversary 
meeting 


The 1972 anniversary meeting, also in Montreux, included a pilgrimage to 
nearbyMont-Pèlerin, where Hayek was “moved profoundly” said Friedman, “and 
in turnmovedthe rest of us by his remarks.” The program, devised by 
Friedman’s Chicagocolleague GeorgeJ Stigler, debatedthe principal problems 
facing liberal economists at the time–inflation, trade unions, growth, trade and the media. The American economist James M Buchanan explainedhis thoughts 
on the economics of politicaland bureaucratic behaviourthat would,fourteen 
years later, win him a Nobel Prize. 


The Montreux meeting was also a chance to confirm the structural decisions taken at the Special Board Meeting. A new committee would review future membership applications. Registrationfees would rise substantially and 
members would no longer be fullysubsidized. Local committees would become largely responsible forthefinance and organization of meetings. 


A 
paid 
Assistant 
Secretary 


The Board also moved to deal withthe strain of centraladministration – of which 
Hunold had complained years before. It appointed the Luxembourg business economist Jean-Pierre Hamilius as asalaried Assistant Secretary, with the dualrole of organizing European meetings andproducing a Newsletter 
tokeep 
members up to date withtheSociety’s (and each others’)activities. 



This first venture into a paid secretariat turnedoutunhappily. Boardmembers tended to load work onto Hamilius, as their paid executive: somost of the organization ofthe 1973 Regional Meeting in Salzburg, Austria– including translating papers between Frenchand German – fell to him. 
At the same time 
hefelt a duty to produce a frequent and high-quality Newsletter, but the burden 
of all these obligations began to overwhelm him. 


Hamilius was exhausted, but carried on:after all, therewas a 1974 General Meeting set forBrussels,Belgium to organize – though this time the local members didmore ofthework. But there was one more difficult taskfor Hamilius todo,namely to securefrom Hunold theearly records of the Society. In 
this he succeeded: these records are now archived in the Hoover Institution in 
California. 


By the mid-1970s, the cost of Hamilius’s ambitious Newsletter 
and his other expenses wererising. TheSociety was living wellbeyond its means. By 1977 the Treasurer, American economics professor Arthur Kemp, wasalarmed enough to propose abandoning both thepost of Assistant Secretary and theNewsletter. By way of compromise, George Stigler, as President, wrote toHamilius, cappinghis 
expenditure and suggesting that the Newsletter 
should appear just once a year. 


Hamilius,proud of whathe hadcreated, resigned indignantly. The officeofAssistant Secretary lapsed and the Newsletter 
disappeared fora time, before 
being revived in a less ambitious format. But atleast the Society was again 
spared another potential financial embarrassment. 


Professional 
financial 
management 


Managing the Society’s financial affairs was no easy task. Today, theaccounts are 
professionally audited andfiled. But in the 1960s and 1970s, Philbrook and Kemp often doubted whether theSociety’s financial records would meet the 
requirements of the US tax authorities – though in fact theSociety’s tax-exempt 
status was never challenged. 


Their main problem was toget the Europeans to take the American accountingstandards seriously. Following thedeparture of Hunold, who raised most of the early funds, Leoni became the main fundraiser for the European meetings;but 
after Leoni’s untimelydeath in 1967, his successorHarris described Leoni’s papers as voluminous but “rather patchy.” 


Not that Harris was a meticulous recordkeeper. Kemp found him “genial but 
elusive”– doing just enough, just intime, to allow Kemp to file theannual taxreturn. But eventhat required constant harrying from Kemp, who expressed his frustration on manyoccasions.Harris, meanwhile, resented the Society’s finances being run entirely from the United States; it reinforced the feeling ofAmerican dominance, and (in those days before email or even fax machines), it could be clumsy and inflexible. He and Villey had even suggested creating aEuropean Treasurer – an idea firmly slapped down by Philbrook. 



The 
cost 
of 
meetings 


Another issue was to ascertain theSociety’s financial responsibility for meetings. Before Kemp, the accounts for meetings were intermingled with those of the 
Society, which maderecord-keeping complex and raised issues for the Society’s US tax status. Kemp insisted on separate accounts for all meetings. Even then, 
before Edwin J Feulner Jr, head of the HeritageFoundation in Washington, took over in1979, the Treasurer was not evenconsulted on the financial plans for meetings – merely presented withthe bills. Today, the Treasurer plays a key role in the financial planning of meetings andin raising support for them, particularlysupport to helpyoung scholars toattend. 


Finance for meetings has always posed problems. The early meetingswere free to participants – important to many, particularly the Germans, because of the currency controls then in force. But at Seelisberg in 1953, members had topay for their own accommodation for the first time, and thereafter thatbecame the 
usual practice. Rising costs meant that from the 1972 Montreux meeting 
onwards,participantshave alsobeenchargeda registrationfee. Yeteven with 
participants paying their own way, substantial funds still have to be raisedfor 
meetings. 


GROWTH 
AND 
RECOGNITION 


Meetings 
in 
the 
1970s 
and 
1980s 


Bleak as the prospects for liberalism still seemed at that anniversary meeting, liberal ideas were about to come intothe ascendancy, bringing the Society further growth and greaterrecognition. The1970s brought Nobel prizes for 
Hayek andFriedman – and more,for Stigler, Buchananand Allais in the 1980s 


By the late 1970s, anew generation was running the Society. Feulner’s election as Treasurer was crucial; a proven fund-raiser and capable administrator, he took over at a timewhen funding for meetings was becoming moreimportant and accounting standards were getting more onerous. Hebecame directly involved in the financial planning of conferences, and more of the general administration of theSociety came torest on his shoulders. 


A patternemerged,still followed today, of General Meetings in even-numbered years and one or more Regional Meetings in odd-numbered years. In the 1970s 
there were five GeneralMeetingsand seven Regional Meetings and the sameagain in the 1980s. 


Among them was the1978 General Meeting in Hong Kong, the first GeneralMeeting to beheld outside Europeand the United States. Feulner raisedsignificant funds, and the meeting was attended by over a hundred members, together with twice that number of guests. And it elected as thenew President 
Manuel Ayau, headof the Universidad Francisco Marroquín inGuatemala – “a 



significant move indicating the changing character ofthe Society,” wrote Hartwell, “particularly since he was succeeded byNishiyama,aJapanese.” 


Continuing 
debates 


Some things did not change–for example the continuing debates about theSociety’s finances. In 1979 the American law and economics professor Henry Manne called for a significant increase in fees for non-academicsand honorariafor theacademic presenters. The academic members, he argued, giveup theirtime todeliver “one of the world’s finest programs” which the non-academics enjoyed at “a ludicrous price.” Theidea was firmly rejected by Ayau. Members, he said,did not agree to speak for a fee, but to “enlighten and to assist those scholars, businessmen, journalists, etc, who are doing something important 
throughout theworld, in their respective spheres of influence.” 


But a new disagreement aroseover the suggestion of a meeting in Taipei, Taiwan. Feulner visited Taiwan andfound “a positive response”to the idea both 
there and in Washington. But it caused problems for Japanese members, andthere were concerns that the Society might stumble into a political minefield, given the hostility between China and Taiwan. Friedman, true toform, argued that the Society should take no account of suchpolitics and should go ahead;but Nishiyama defused things by suggesting a meeting in Tokyo for 1977, which the 
Taiwanese could attend. Eventually, at the 1976meeting in St Andrews, Scotland 
(held there to mark the200th anniversary of Adam Smith’s The 
Wealth 
of 
Nations, it was decided that Nishiyama would organize the General Meeting in Hong Kong in 1978, and that it would bepreceded by a Special Meetingin Taipei. 


A decade later, ameeting was held in Taipei. Again,it was not a formal Regional Meeting but a Special Meeting of Society members who were also attending the 1988 Tokyo/Kyoto meeting in Japan. 


Growth 
without 
(much) 
disagreement 


The 1980s was a decade of growth without great disagreement. Membership rose, meetings occurred regularly and attendance was high. The finances improved, largely though Feulner’s fundraising skills and prudent management. As the cost of meetings continued to soar, the Board decided that it would not consider offers to host a meeting unless there wereassurances offinancial 
support; and Feulner became directly involvedin the financialplanning of 
events. 


The Board also decided that membership dues should always be high enoughto 
cover the costs of theNewsletter, whichhad re-emerged under a series of editors. 
Meanwhile, generous donations were received, providing for a HayekEssay 
Prize and travelfunds for young scholars. 


There were the usual discussions about organization. A committee under Manne, like others before it, failed to comeup with acceptable suggestions. With things going well there was little agitation for change. Friedman, still concerned about 



how the Society was changing, suggested creating a “Senate”of “older and wiser 
heads” to act in an advisory role; but even this modest idea was not taken up until the2012 General Meeting in Prague. 


Size 
and 
publicity 


With a clutchof Nobel prizes going to members in the 1970s and 1980s,theSociety’s status rose, its fame spread and its meetings grew still more. But thisbrought problems beyond the perennial debate about size. Other groups were now fixing their own meetings around those of the Society, gainingfrom the synergy. The Board moved to discouragethis, worried that the Society’sindependence might be underminedifit cameto be associated with other, often 
political,organizations. More recently, however, the Board has accepted that there can be benefits from coinciding, at least with other non-political and liberalbodies, such as groups of young scholars from whichfuture members might 
emerge. 


Media interest was another issueraised by the growing recognitionof the 
Society and its members. Fearingthatmediareporting wouldinhibit members from speaking frankly, the Board moved to curb it, emphasising the essentially private nature of the discussions. The ban on direct reporting of what people say at meetings continues, even in this age of instant communication: though someprominent members may be in demand for interviews, these always take placeoutside of the conference hall and never disclose what any individual has said within it. Meetings are not secret,but in the interests of candor,the discussion 
remains private. 


Into 
Eastern 
Europe 


Members of the Society remained well aware that freedomwasstill threatened in large parts of the world. But in the 1980s and 1990s they hadtheexhilaratingfeeling that things were at last going their way. Several countries, starting with Margaret Thatcher’s government in Britain, wereprivatizing their state 
industries; governments from China to India to America to France were 
liberalising, retrenching or cutting taxes; and progress was being made on international free trade. Thenin 1989, withastonishing speed, the IronCurtain 
fell and theeconomic disaster that lay behind it was exposed. 


The 1990 General Meeting took place in Munich, still officially in West Germany but soon tobe part of a re-united Germany. The theme was Europe 
in 
an 
Open 
World 
Order 
and the mood was upbeat. Speakers from Eastern Europewereinvited, among them Václav Klaus, whowould subsequently become Prime 
Minister and thenPresident ofthe Czech Republic. But at Munich he attended as a mere economist, as unsureof the Society as it was of him: Madsen Pirie of the 
Adam Smith Institute, who was introducing him on a panel, even hadto ask how 
to pronounce his name. 


Plans werelaid for a Regional Meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia in1991. It was 
premature toimagine that freedomwasnow completely safe; but there wasa 



broad feeling that the Society’s hard and long effort had at last paid off. Other meetings would take place in the formerEast Europe: in Potsdam, Germany in 
1999and Bratislava, Slovakia 2001, and Prague again in 2012. 


The 
death 
of 
Hayek 


Buttheeuphoria ofthe times was tinged by sadness at the passing, of 1992, of 
the Society’s founder, Friedrich Hayek. He had lived just long enough tosee the Iron Curtain fall and Soviet collectivism thoroughly discredited. His death was marked by a brief ceremony at the1992 General Meeting in Vancouver, Canada; and the 1994 General Meeting inCannes, France became a good opportunity to review a number of Hayekian themes – spontaneous order, business cycles, 
capitalism and the historians, and the ethics of freedom. 


The 1996 General Meeting in Vienna, Austria addressed some very modern 
issues – environment, healthcare,privatization, corruption, crime, immigration – 
fully in line with Hayek’s original hope of making liberal philosophy relevant to contemporary concerns. And then it was time to mark another milestone – the 
fiftieth anniversary of the original meeting at Mont-Pèlerin, celebrated with a 
General meeting in Washington DC, in 1998. 


Special 
meetings 


The Society now launched itself into another new ventures – a series of Special Meetings, initiated mainly by Greg Lindsay of the Centre for Independent Studies in Australia, and LindaWhetstone, the daughter of Sir Antony Fisher and a Board member of the Atlas Foundation.Their aim was to open up new countries to liberal ideas and to scout for potential new members in places where the Society 
was under-represented, such as Bali, Indonesia (1999), Goa,India (2002)and 
Colombo and Kandalama, Sri Lanka(2004), Nairobi, Kenya (2007), Delhi, India (2011) andFez, Morocco (2012).Alongsidethe 2011 Regional Meeting in 
Istanbul, Turkey, this last conference marked an attempt toexplorethe 
relevance of liberal ideas in Muslimregions. A2012 meeting on evolution and 
economics, imaginatively sited in the Galapagos Islands, brokenew intellectualground too. 


People from policy thinktanks, such as Lindsay, were by now playing a larger partinthe Society’saffairs.As meetings grew larger and costlier, they became 
more difficult for individual academicsto organize and finance. Since the Vienna, Austria meetingin 1996, GeneralMeetings havebeen run by hosts with the backup 
ofa research institute or similar body. 


This change is also reflectedamong the Society’s officers. Apartfrom Hunold, 
almost all of the early Board and Councilmembers were academics. Nowit is 
common to see businesspeople, journalists, lawyers and think tank executives on 
the Board. The first non-academicto be elected President was Harris – by then ennobled toLord Harris of HighCross – in 1982. But recently there havebeenseveral more: Feulner in 1996, the Uruguayan lawyer Ramón Diaz in1998 and 
Lindsay in 2006. 



Other 
innovations 


Meetings changed and developed too. The 2002 General Meeting in London, England, featured lunch ‘topic tables’ and after-hours meetings to allow for more intimate and detailed discussion on subjects chosen by members. More effort was put in to providing scholarships for young people. Roving microphonesreplaced standing microphones inorder to help the debate flow better. The conference was held over a weekend instead of during the week. And the traditional excursion was moved to the end in order to condense the formal part of the meeting for the benefit of busy members. 


Some of theLondon changes were repeated in subsequent meetings, others not. The organizers of the 2009 Regional Meeting in Stockholm went sofaras to book 
a cheaper hotel so that extra funds could be devoted to scholarships; and thetopic tables reappeared at various times. But conferences havemostly reverted to week-time, andthe idea of moving the excursion did not catch on: ever sincethe first meeting, which featured one half-day and two full-day excursions, theinformal outings have been regarded as a key way to promote greater personal intimacy between members – an integral part of the meeting rather than a mereextra. 


Reaffirmation 
and 
improvement 


The activities and aims of the Society were reviewed again at an informal 
meeting of the Board and senior members at the2005 Regional Meetingin Reykjavik, Iceland. It proposed that the membershipcommittee shouldact as 
‘talentscouts’, andthere wasa need to attract people from new countries, with perhaps more Special Meetings like those in Bali, Goa and SriLanka. 


The group resolved that membership nominations should be doneonline – a new Society website was nowup andrunning–andthat there shouldbe ‘fast track’ membership process for prominent liberals, even if they had not attended earlier meetings.Membership applications would be reviewed twice a year, instead of applicants having to wait for the next General Meeting. There was debatetoo on how to retain young members, who came as Hayek Prize scholars, butoften then dropped out because of the cost of attendinginternationalmeetings. 


In another discussion redolent of Hayek’s original proposals for a liberal 
‘academy’, the group agreedthat the Society’s intellectual progams needed to be strengthened; programs should address current threats to liberty, such asregulation and populism, and explore the ethical case for freedom, not just theeconomic case. The Society’s intellectual depthand breadthwas seen as giving it a uniqueedge over other liberal-minded organizations that had arisen. 


Accordinglythere was a strong view that the Society should adhereto its 
intellectual purpose – though it should remain open to non-academics. As often before, the meeting felt that the Society needed more non-economists such as 
historians and philosophers. As Feulner had written inhis 1999Intellectual 



Pilgrims, “This imbalance in our membershiphas never been rectified and may account for the fact that, while we have brilliantly succeeded in developing a critique of, and alternative to, economicinterventionism, Hayek’s goal offormulatinga ‘comprehensive philosophy of freedom’continues to challenge us.” 


New 
York 


But one of the biggest challenges for the Society that decade wasan economic 
one:thefinancial crash of 2008. This was widely reported in the media and 
among intellectuals as a ‘failure ofcapitalism’. Public faith in free markets took a severe blow, and there werenumerous callsfor Keynesian-style policies, 
involving more public spending, cheap credit and money-creation. 


The Anglo-Indian development economist Deepak Lal responded by organizing a2009 Special Meeting on the crisis, held in the world’s leading financial centre, New York. Most participants there saw thecrash as a crisis ofpolitics, not 
markets. It was just the inevitable result of a long, unsustainable boom created 
by thepoliticians’ and central bankers’ loose money and cheap credit policies. Hayek, of course, had won his Nobel Prize largely for his1930s work on such boom-bust cycles. 


The meeting marked the start of the concerted intellectual fightbackof freemarketeersto 
the criticism they had suffered. Forbes 
publisher Steve Forbes scornfully debunked ideasthat the crisis was caused by the ‘greed’ ofbankers: 
since bankers had always been accused of greed, why didit manifest itself just then? The ‘Austrian’ and Monetarist views of boom-bust cycles being set off by an excess of credit or money werere-iterated. And the Nobel economist Gary S 
Becker proposed solutions to the‘too big to fail’ problem: larger banks, for example, should face more onerous reserve requirements, reflecting the systemic risks they pose; but regulation on small banks should beeased inorderto encourage competition – whichitself wouldhave restrained some of the worst 
excesses of the boom years. 


The 
returning 
threat 


To some extent, thefinancial crisis madeliberals realize theimportance of developing and disseminating their ideas even more. By 2012,the Society had grown to 699 members – some 140had beenadded following adecision, taken at the 2010 Sydney General Meeting, to allow expansion up to1,000 members.Throughprudent management and despite the crash, there was nearly $1m in reserves. And at last, Milton Friedman’s idea of an advisory Senate was made a reality, with all past Presidents, Secretaries and Treasurers joining the body. 


The 2012 General Meeting in Prague was a glitteringaffair, with meetings in 
Prague Castle, hosted by the President of the Czech Republic,Václav Klaus – the East European economist who caused so much interest at the 1990 Munich 
meeting. 



And yet the 2012 event was more downbeat than the 1991 meeting held in Prague soon after the fall of theIron Curtain. More than two decades on, members had become acutely aware of“liberalism’s manifest inabilityto 
translate itsintellectual victories into politicalvictories that seriouslyroll back 
the size and power of thesocialist welfarestate,” as Feulnerhad put it. 


“Ideas,” he had told the special50thanniversary gatheringin Mont-Pèlerin, “are decisive, but not self-implementing.” Big government had been discredited 
intellectually, but government was still bigger than ever; central planning had been abandoned, but a mass of suffocating regulations had filled the interventionist void. Soviet socialism might have ended, but therewerenew threats to freedom – and the Prague meeting focused on the growingpoliticization, regulation and centralization of the European Union, and the single European currency that was raising tensions between countries andmaking thepost-crasheconomic adjustment much moredifficult. (For once, this was a discussion about currency that did not cause dissent.) 


IMPACT, 
STRENGTH 
AND 
CHALLENGES 


The 
Society’s 
contribution 


Whateverthe challenges now faced in Europeand some other regions, theSociety has good reason not to be downbeat. Today’schallenges seem less grave than the group faced at Mont-Pèlerin in 1947. The presumption of ‘rational’economic intervention has been replaced by scepticism about the abilities ofgovernments and an appreciationof the power of markets. Once-closed regions 
are openingup to investment and trade. Freedom isexpanding in countries that 
were once bywords for oppression. 


And new liberal ideas are taking hold. A score of countriesare replacing their old state-run Ponzi-scheme pension systems withindividuatedprivate pension 
accounts, like those designed by Chile’s Labor minister (and Society member), 
José Piñera. School choice and school vouchers, an idea rediscovered and popularized by Friedman, are reforming and improving education in many more 
places. Property rightsare being restored and business paperwork scaled back in large parts of South America, thanks to Peruvian economist and Society member Hernando de Soto. 


It isimpossible to measure the impact ofthe Society in this revolution. In a sense, 
while its members may have considerableimpact, the Society itself has none: it is, in Hayek’s words, only a “community of liberal scholars” with no policies and 
program ofits own. But by bringing authoritative liberal thinkers together, and 
in expanding the scope and depth of liberal ideas, it ensured that liberalism could not simply be ignored. By offering a challenging critique of socialistideas,itguaranteed that socialism could not simply be taken for granted. By providing 
mutual support,it gaveisolated liberals the strength tohold their ground. And by 
establishing an international network throughwhich liberal ideas could be 



disseminated, and through the policy institutes that promoted its principles, it undoubtedly has changed events. 


Strength 
through 
diversity 
and 
debate 


Like liberalism itself, the Society’s membership has grown and spread. It started 
as a group of West Europeans andAmericans;and indeed there were tensions between them. Now there are large representations from Japan, Australasia, South and Central America, and Eastern Europe– and growinginterest in Africa 
and the Middle East. But the tensionshave subsided; the Society’s members prudentlyensure a widegeographical spread on their Board, and seethe importance oftaking their ideas into new places. 


Members share a commitment to the free society and free economy; but they have a widerange of views on what thatmeans andhowto achieve it.And awide range of backgrounds too: around half are academics, mostly economists, but theSociety benefits from having many ableand accomplishedmembers frombusiness, think tanks, politics, journalism, and public administration. 


Like any association,theSocietyhasitsinternalcritics. But as Hartwell points out, such criticism aims to improvehow the Society works, not to change its fundamental purpose. Membership is seen as an honour, and the Society gives its members an enormoussenseof belonging to something important, stimulating 
and mutually supportive. 


The 
continuing 
challenge 


Andmembers agreethat the intellectual challenges continue. As Feulner put it, 
“Living in a society in whicheveryone ‘naturally’ looksto government to solve every problem, how do we return powerto the individual?” Making the welfare-statesocieties of the West into free ones seems just as difficult as making the communist societies of the East into capitalist ones. 


And there are new and more subtle problems about suchtransition processes themselves. Tyranny may be giving way todemocracy in largeparts of the world, but as Society members have explained, unlimited democracy can actually threaten freedom by giving majorities the power to oppress and exploit minorities. Likewise, more countries are experiencing freedom, but as Hartwell observes, freedom brings personalresponsibility and moral dilemmas: how canwe helppeople develop that responsibility and articulate the moralitythat 
allows human beings to live together in harmony? 


At the twenty-fifthanniversary of the Society, some members argued thatithaddone its job and should be disbanded. But the job of defending liberty never 
ends: each decade brings new challenges. As Hayek said when he founded the 
Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, working out a philosophy of freedom is a task that 
demands “continuous effort.”
